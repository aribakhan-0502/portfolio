### Welcome to my portfolio!

This repository showcases a selection of data science projects that demonstrate my ability to leverage data for insights and innovation. Each project involves hands-on experience with various tools and techniques, including data generation, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

## Projects

### 1. **ETL Pipeline with BI Dashboard**
- **Description:** Generated synthetic data to simulate a hypothetical public transport system for Karachi using web scraping, logic, and assumptions. The data was integrated into a PostgreSQL database and visualized using a Power BI dashboard.
- **Tools used:** Python, SQL, Postgresql, Jupyter Notebook, Power BI

### 2. **Master Function and Pipeline for Machine Learning Tasks**
- **Description:** Developed a master function to automate data preprocessing, feature selection with cross-validation, including tasks like data cleaning, EDA, treatment of missing values and outliers. Applied class imbalance solutions and tested multiple machine learning models, comparing their performance on the pre-processed dataset.
- **Tools used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook

### 3. **Data Cleaning Tech Employee Survey Responses**
- **Description:** Cleaned and processed survey data from a Kaggle dataset on mental health attitudes in the tech workplace. The project involved treating absurd values and visualizing insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Tools used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use
Each project is organized into its own directory, containing relevant code, datasets, and documentation. To explore a project, navigate to its folder and learn more in the respective README files or notebooks.
